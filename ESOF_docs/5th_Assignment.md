 ##**Software Maintenance/Evolution - Introduction** <a name ="intro"></a>
 
 After analysing this project's tests, we aim to analyze the software maintanability and evolution of Flare ([game](https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-game) and [engine](https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine)) and to improve it's functionality, by adding a new feature. In this report we will present some interesting metrics regarding the project, and will describe what feature we chose to make and how we implemented it.
 
 ##**Software Maintainability - SIG metrics** <a name= "sig"></a>
 
 [Software maintainability](http://www.castsoftware.com/glossary/software-maintainability) is defined as the degree to which an application is understood, repaired, or enhanced. Software maintainability is important because it consumes range between 40% to 80% of software costs in a project. Bellow we will present some curious metrics from the Software Improvement Group (SIG) of [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com). Better Code Hub is a web-based source code analysis service that checks the database for compliance with the ten guidelines presented in _Building Maintainable Software: Ten Guidelines for Future-Proof Code_ (BMS).
