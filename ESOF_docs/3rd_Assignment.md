##**Introduction to Software Architecture and the 4+1 Architectural View Model** <a name ="intro"></a>

This report aims to explain some aspects relating the software architecture of the Flare Game/Flare Engine projects. This software architecture is based on the [4+1 Mode of Software Architecture](http://cic.puj.edu.co/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=materias:mazeiar-kruchten-4_1.pdf).

According to this view model, the views are used to describe the system from the viewpoint of different stakeholders, such as end-users, developers and project managers. The four views of the model are logical, implementation, process and deployment view. The aditional view (+1) is related with the [use-cases](https://github.com/Francisca96/flare-game/blob/master/ESOF_docs/res/use_case.PNG), which diagram was already presented on the [last report](https://github.com/Francisca96/flare-game/blob/master/ESOF_docs/2nd_Assignment.md).

In this report, we will be presenting the 4 views regarding this view model.

##**Logical View** <a name ="log"></a>

This kind of view concerns the functionality that the language provides to the end-user. The UML diagrams that can be used to represent the logical view are: Sequence Diagram, Communication Diagram and Class Diagram.

It is important to notice that, in this view, we will focus mostly on the engine of the game, since the quantity and diversity of the modules that exist on the game reduce the importance of their architecture, because the modules just have to be done in a way that makes them able to be integrated on the engine.

##**Implementation View** <a name ="imp"></a>

##**Process View** <a name ="pro"></a>
